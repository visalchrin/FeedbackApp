# School Feedback Project

**This feedback project** is the feedback website, where student can easily give feedback to all courses that they studied.This project was implemented to help school or university get more data to improve their courses' quality and also improve their lecturers. Moreover, univerisity or school might easily use that data to grade their staffs in more effeciency and acurately way. One of the reason that I create this project is because of some students from developing countries have no ways to raise their voices to make any changes in their schools or universities. I believe that students are a big part of the school, so they must be able to raise their voices as well as the teachers or the universities.In the name of the school or university, we must listen to them to get real feedbacks in order to improve our educational systems with better quality and creative for the next generation. All in all, this project will help all students to raising their voices without fears about their schools and lecturers to any courses that they have taken.

## Thankful Statement

This is the final project for CS50's Web Programming With Python and JavaScript.
I am very thankful to all cs50's staffs for making this course availabe for free to all people around the world. I believe that cs50 is one of the best course in Computer Science on the internet. Moreover, this course do not only give the foundamental concepts of programming, but it also inspired me to be a problem solver not just a simple programmer.
Lastly, I would like to say thank you to Professor David J.Malon and Brian Yuu for your hard work on creating and teaching these courses.
